# Pipeline Rules

## Stage 0 — Routing (orchestrator, pre-stage)

Before Stage 1, the orchestrator must decide which track to run. Four tracks
exist and they share gates, agents, and artefacts where they overlap, but
differ on which stages run and how many approvals a gate requires:

| Track | Command | Runs | Stage 5 approvals | Retro |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full** | `/pipeline` | Stages 1–9 as defined below | 2 per area (matrix) | Full Stage 9 |
| **Quick** | `/quick` | 1 (mini-brief) → 4 (single dev) → 5 (1 cross-area reviewer) → 6 → 7 (auto) → 8 (optional) → 9 (abbreviated) | 1 per area | Single-dev contribution + Principal synthesis |
| **Config-only** | `/config-only` | 4 (platform) → 4.5 (lint + config validate) → 6 (no-regression) → 8 (optional) | N/A | Fix-log entry only |
| **Dep update** | `/dep-update` | 4 (platform + changelog scan + SCA) → 5 (single supply-chain reviewer) → 6 (no-regression) → 8 (optional) | 1 (supply-chain focus) | Fix-log entry only |
| **Hotfix** | `/hotfix` | 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 (design skipped; blast-radius rule active) | 2 per area | Abbreviated single-section retro |

The routing decision is recorded in `pipeline/context.md` under `## Brief
Changes` as `TRACK: <name>` with a one-line rationale. Each gate file in
`pipeline/gates/` includes `"track": "<name>"` in its body so the
gate-validator and downstream tooling can branch on track.

**Safety stoplist** — the full `/pipeline` track is mandatory for any change
that touches:

- Authentication / authorization / session handling
- Cryptography, key management, secrets rotation
- PII / payments / regulated-data handling
- Schema migrations, destructive data changes
- Feature-flag introduction (toggling existing flags is fine in `/config-only`)
- New external dependencies (upgrades are fine in `/dep-update`)

The lighter tracks (`/quick`, `/config-only`, `/dep-update`) must not be
used to bypass this list. If the orchestrator is uncertain whether a
change crosses the stoplist, it must default to `/pipeline`.

The rules below describe the **full** track. Lighter-track deltas live
in the track's own command file (`.claude/commands/{track}.md`). When a
gate in a lighter track differs from the full-track definition (for
example, Stage 5 needing only one approval in `/quick`), the track file
overrides the rule here — the track file is authoritative for its own
track.

---

## Stage 1 — Requirements (PM)

Invoke: `pm` agent
Input: user's feature request
Output: `pipeline/brief.md`
Gate file: `pipeline/gates/stage-01.json`
Gate key: `"status": "PASS"`

The PM defines acceptance criteria and scope. Engineers do not begin design
until the gate passes. After gate passes → HUMAN CHECKPOINT A.

---

## Stage 2 — Design (Principal + Dev input)

Step 2a — Principal drafts:
  Invoke: `principal` agent
  Input: `pipeline/brief.md`
  Output: `pipeline/design-spec.md` (status: DRAFT)

Step 2b — Dev annotation (parallel, read-only):
  Invoke in parallel: `dev-backend`, `dev-frontend`, `dev-platform`
  Each appends concerns to: `pipeline/design-review-notes.md`
  These are read-only passes — no code written yet.

Step 2c — Principal chairs review:
  Invoke: `principal` agent
  Input: `pipeline/design-spec.md` + `pipeline/design-review-notes.md`
  Output: updated `pipeline/design-spec.md`, ADR files in `pipeline/adr/`
  Gate file: `pipeline/gates/stage-02.json`
  Gate keys: `"arch_approved": true` AND `"pm_approved": true`
  For PM approval: invoke `pm` agent to confirm scope fit after Principal approves.

After both approvals → HUMAN CHECKPOINT B.

---

## Stage 3 — Pre-Build Clarification

Check `pipeline/context.md` for any lines starting with `QUESTION:` that lack a `PM-ANSWER:`.
If any exist: invoke `pm` agent with those questions before proceeding.
If none: proceed immediately.

---

## Stage 4 — Build (3 Devs, parallel via git worktrees)

Each dev works in its own worktree:
  `git worktree add ../dev-team-backend feature/backend`
  `git worktree add ../dev-team-frontend feature/frontend`
  `git worktree add ../dev-team-platform feature/platform`

Invoke in parallel:
  `dev-backend`  → `src/backend/`  → `pipeline/pr-backend.md`
  `dev-frontend` → `src/frontend/` → `pipeline/pr-frontend.md`
  `dev-platform` → `src/infra/`    → `pipeline/pr-platform.md`

Gate file per PR: `pipeline/gates/stage-04-{area}.json`
All three must have `"status": "PASS"` before proceeding.

---

## Stage 5 — Peer Code Review (Agent Teams preferred, sequential fallback)

Each dev reviews the OTHER TWO devs' PRs.
Review matrix:
  `dev-backend`  reviews: frontend + platform → writes `pipeline/code-review/by-backend.md`
  `dev-frontend` reviews: backend + platform  → writes `pipeline/code-review/by-frontend.md`
  `dev-platform` reviews: backend + frontend  → writes `pipeline/code-review/by-platform.md`

### READ-ONLY Reviewer Rule (strictly enforced)

During a Stage 5 review invocation, a reviewer agent writes ONLY to:
  - `pipeline/code-review/by-{reviewer}.md` (their review file)
  - `pipeline/gates/stage-05-{area}.json` (append-only approval gate)

A reviewer agent MUST NOT:
  - Use `Write` or `Edit` on any file under `src/`
  - Amend or refactor the author's code, even for a one-line "obvious fix"
  - Add themselves to `approvals` in a stage-05 gate if they modified any
    source file during the same invocation — the gate is then invalid

If the reviewer finds a bug, missing guard, or other BLOCKER: they write
`REVIEW: CHANGES REQUESTED` in their review file, list the blocker, and
halt. The orchestrator re-invokes the owning dev agent to fix it in their
own worktree. **No fix-forward. No exceptions for "small" patches.**

Rationale: silent inline fixes bypass the owning dev, skip re-review of
the patched lines, and leave no audit trail tying the patch to a
CHANGES-REQUESTED → addressed loop. If the one-line patch has a second
bug, no reviewer is assigned to catch it.

### Gate Merge Strategy for Stage 5

Each area gate (`pipeline/gates/stage-05-{area}.json`) must accumulate 2 approvals.
When a reviewer writes their approval:
- If the gate file does not yet exist: write a new gate with `"approvals": ["your-agent-name"]`
- If the gate file exists: read it first, then update `"approvals"` to append your name

Never overwrite a gate that already has entries in `"approvals"`. Append only.
The gate reaches `"status": "PASS"` only when `"approvals"` contains 2 entries.
If a reviewer writes `REVIEW: CHANGES REQUESTED`, do not add their name to `"approvals"`;
instead add to `"changes_requested"` and leave `"status": "FAIL"`.

Pre-read requirement (pass to each reviewer agent):
  - `pipeline/brief.md`
  - `pipeline/design-spec.md`
  - `pipeline/adr/` (all files)
  - The other reviewer's file if already written (sequential fallback)

Gate per PR area: needs 2 REVIEW:APPROVED entries in gate file
  `pipeline/gates/stage-05-{area}.json`

On architectural escalation: invoke `principal` agent. Principal ruling is binding.
On deadlock (reviewers disagree, no escalation): invoke `principal` agent to decide.

---

## Stage 6 — Test & CI (Platform Dev)

Invoke: `dev-platform` agent
Input: `src/` + `pipeline/brief.md` (acceptance criteria)
Output: `pipeline/test-report.md`
Gate file: `pipeline/gates/stage-06.json`
Gate key: `"status": "PASS"` with `"all_acceptance_criteria_met": true`

On failure: identify owning dev from failing test, invoke that dev with failure context.
Retry limit: 3 cycles. On 3rd failure of same test: auto-escalate to `principal`.

After gate passes → HUMAN CHECKPOINT C.

---

## Stage 7 — PM Sign-off

Invoke: `pm` agent
Input: `pipeline/test-report.md` + `pipeline/brief.md`
Output: sign-off appended to `pipeline/gates/stage-07.json`
Gate key: `"pm_signoff": true`

On NO: PM writes delta list. Return to Stage 4 with delta items only.
Delta items must not trigger a full pipeline rerun — scope them explicitly.

---

## Stage 8 — Deploy (Platform Dev)

Invoke: `dev-platform` agent
Precondition: confirm `pipeline/gates/stage-07.json` has `"pm_signoff": true`
Output: `pipeline/deploy-log.md`
Gate file: `pipeline/gates/stage-08.json`
Gate key: `"status": "PASS"`

Post-deploy: invoke `pm` agent to write stakeholder summary.

---

## Stage 9 — Retrospective (all agents → Principal synthesis)

Full protocol: see `.claude/rules/retrospective.md`.

Runs automatically after Stage 8 (PASS or FAIL) and after any red halt.
Not gated by user approval — retros on failed runs are the most valuable.

Step 9a — Contribution (parallel, read-heavy):
  Invoke in parallel: `pm`, `principal`, `dev-backend`, `dev-frontend`,
  `dev-platform`. Each appends a section to `pipeline/retrospective.md`
  using the four-heading template. Each produces one concrete lesson.

Step 9b — Synthesis:
  Invoke: `principal` agent.
  Input: `pipeline/retrospective.md` + `pipeline/lessons-learned.md`
  Output: synthesis block prepended to retrospective, updated
  `pipeline/lessons-learned.md` (max 2 promotions, retire rules proved
  wrong or reinforced ≥5 times without defect).
  Gate file: `pipeline/gates/stage-09.json`
  Gate key: `"status": "PASS"` (informational — only FAIL if synthesis
  itself failed)

After gate: the orchestrator prints the synthesis block and the list of
promoted/retired lessons to the user. No checkpoint — pipeline ends here.

**Seeding**: on the first pipeline run in a project, `pipeline/lessons-learned.md`
does not exist. Principal creates it during synthesis if any lesson is
promoted. Until then, agents skip the "read lessons-learned" step.

## Stage Duration Expectations

Typical durations for each stage. These are guidelines, not hard limits —
Claude Code does not enforce timeouts on agent execution. If a stage
seems stalled, use `/status` to check progress and `/pipeline-context`
for a full state dump.

| Stage | Typical Duration | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 — Requirements | 2-5 min | Single agent (PM). Fast unless scope is ambiguous. |
| 2 — Design | 5-15 min | Sequential: draft → annotation → review. Longest non-build stage. |
| 3 — Clarification | <1 min | Pass-through if no open questions. |
| 4 — Build | 5-20 min | Parallel (3 devs). Wall-clock = slowest dev. Complexity-dependent. |
| 5 — Code Review | 5-15 min | 3 reviewers, each reading 2 PRs. Sequential fallback is slower. |
| 6 — Test & CI | 3-10 min | Depends on test suite size and whether retries are needed. |
| 7 — PM Sign-off | 1-3 min | Single agent review. |
| 8 — Deploy | 3-10 min | Docker build + smoke tests. Network-dependent. |
| 9 — Retrospective | 3-8 min | Parallel contributions + Principal synthesis. Skippable only for trivial hotfixes. |

**Full pipeline**: 28-88 minutes typical, depending on feature complexity.

**Stall indicators**:
- Stage 4 taking >30 min: check if a dev agent hit an ambiguity and wrote
  a `QUESTION:` to `pipeline/context.md` without the orchestrator noticing.
- Stage 6 retry loops: check if the same test is failing repeatedly
  (auto-escalates after 3 identical failures).
- Any stage with no gate file written after 15 min: likely a context or
  permission issue. Check the agent's output for errors.

**Claude Code session limits**: Claude Code conversations have a context
window limit. Long pipeline runs may trigger automatic compaction. The
`/pipeline-context` command captures state before compaction, and
`.claude/rules/compaction.md` tells Claude what to preserve.
